NAME
       _printf - formatted output to standard output

SYNOPSIS
       #include <main.h>

       int _printf(const char *format, ...);

DESCRIPTION
       _printf() is a function that produces output according to a format. It is similar to the standard printf function but with limited format specifiers.

       The function takes a format string and optional additional arguments, and prints the formatted output to the standard output.

       The supported format specifiers are:
       - %c: Print a character.
       - %s: Print a string.
       - %%: Print a percent sign.
       - %d or %i: Print an integer.

RETURN VALUE
       The _printf function returns the number of characters printed (excluding the null byte used to end the output to strings). If an error occurs, -1 is returned. If the format string is empty ('\0'), 0 is returned.

EXAMPLE
       #include <stdio.h>
       #include "main.h"

       int main() {
           int count;

           count = _printf("Hello, %s! You have %d apples.\n", "John", 10);
           _printf("Printed %d characters.\n", count);

           return 0;
       }

SEE ALSO
       printf(3), write(2)
